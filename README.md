I read a lot of books but after I finish reading them I often don't remember all the most salient parts of the book. 
So I started taking notes. 
This capstone project is built on this idea.
I used the Open Library Covers API to fetch book covers, created a database to store read books. 
Users have a way to add new data about books, update previous reviews and delete entries as well as being able to sort their book entries by rating and recency.
